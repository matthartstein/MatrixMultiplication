1.) How many times is each element of each input matrix loaded during the
    execution of the kernel?
	-> Each element of the 16 x 16 input matrices, M and N, is loaded 16
	   times during the execution of the kernel.

2.) What is the memory-access to floating-point computation ratio (i.e. the 
    total number of memory accesses divided by the total number of floating-
    point operations) in each thread? Consider multiplication and addition
    as separate operations, and ignore the global memory store at the end.
    Only count global memory loads when calculating the total number of 
    memory accesses.
	-> Thread performs 32 memory accesses to load values. Along the
	   computation, it does 16 multiplications and 16 sums. Therefore, the
	   total number of memory accesses and floating point computations are
	   32. Also, the memory-access to floating-point computation ratio in 
	   each thread is 1.
